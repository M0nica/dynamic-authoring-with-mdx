# Migrating Blog to MDX 📝

# Why I migrated to MDX

- FOMO Driven Development
- to create engaging and interactive content!

# What is Remark?

A collection of Markdown parser plugins that check, lint, generate and compiles Markdown.

https://remark.js.org/

# Transformer Remark Plugins

In Gatsby, Remark Transformer plugins are used in the `gatsby-config` to transform
Markdown on a site into HTML.

# Remark plugins can be used to:

- autolink headers with anchor tags
- process responsive images
- add syntax highlight
- embed content
- and more!

# Goodbye gatsby-transformer-remark, Hello gatsby-plugin-mdx 👋🏾

- Gatsby-plugin-mdx is the official integration for using MDX with Gatsby

- Can be used in combination with Remark plugins.

<SpeakerNotes>
  {' '}
  Considered a regular Gatsby plugin vs. Remark plugin{' '}

# Cannot Query Field

<Callout variant="danger">
  error Cannot query field "body" on type "Mdx". Did you mean "rawBody"?
  graphql/template-strings
</Callout>

I ran into an error accessing some of the fields that should be available for mdx nodes like `body`, `timeToRead` and `excerpt`.

---

# Debugging Conflicting Gatsby Plugins

1. Commented out all of the plugins in gatsbyRemarkPlugins
2. Confirmed that all of the data that should be available to query from mdx was available without Remark plugins.
3. Re-added each plugin one-by-one to identify the culprit

# Resolving Conflicting Gatsby Plugins

- There was a conflict\* with gatsby-plugin-mdx and the plugin, gatsby-plugin-my-social-cards, used to generate Open Graph images for all of my posts.

\* Multiple plugins that transform Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) can sometimes conflict or behave in unexpected ways. Sometimes re-ordering plugins in `gatsby-config` can resolve this type issue.

- Fix: replacing gatsby-plugin-my-social-cards with gatsby-remark-twitter-cards

# What have I done with it?

Upgraded the code snippets on my site’s blog post to be powered by React a.k.a MDX!

I wanted to be able to easily add additional functionality to code snippets on my site like click to copy functionality

I was using `gatsby-remark-prismjs` and ran into some issue since currently additional support for PrismJS plugin environment variables is [in development](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20642).

I decided to switch to `prism-react-renderer` in order to tap into the more robust functionality that’s available with React/MDX.

which highlights based on line number.

Prism-react-renderer is a lot more flexible then gatsby-remark-prismjs

> I was wondering how certain websites are able to display language and copy to clipboard feature as seen in the photo below.

> A custom code block for MDX and some CSS: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/www/src/components/code-block/index.js > https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/www/src/utils/styles/global.js

Display language is also possible with gatsby-remark-prismjs https://www.lekoarts.de/en/blog/language-tabs-for-gatsbys-code-blocks

    - Added callouts with different variants
    - Table of contents — reduced amount of code that needed to be written to load table of contents

- what issues did I run into it with Gatsby? - conficting plugins
- Migrated from “gatsby-remark-prismjs” to “prism-react-renderer”: “^1.1.1” (much fancier code snippets) 👨‍🍳 - https://github.com/M0nica/monica-site-playground/compare/improveCodeBlocks
