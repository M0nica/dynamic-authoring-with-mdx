# Why did I migrated from Remark to MDX?

- FOMO Driven Development
- to be able to use React components to create more engaging and interactive content

<SpeakerNotes>
  I consider my personal site my personal playground and was intrigued by MDX
  and thought why not upgrade to MDX? I was hearing other developers talk about
  the superpowers of MDX and wanted to check it out for myself. I was especially
  interested in creating engaging and interactive content and had seen fun
  examples of content that resonated with me that used MDX.

# Transformer Remark

- Remark is a collection of Markdown parser plugins that check, lint, generate and compiles Markdown.

- In Gatsby, Remark Transformer plugins are used in the `gatsby-config` to transform
  Markdown on a site into HTML.

<img style={{ maxWidth: "50%", textAlign: "center" }} src="/MDXtoHTML.png" />

<SpeakerNotes>
  My website was a Gatsby site that uses Remark plugins to transform Markdown
  into HTML. A lot of this parsing functionality is setup within the
  gatsby-config file. The config is also where other site configuration such as
  metadata is constructed.
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Remark plugins can be used to:

- autolink headers with anchor tags
- process responsive images
- add syntax highlight
- embed content
- and more!

<SpeakerNotes>
  I've used Remark plugins for things like adding anchor tags to each header
  within an article, processing responsive images, adding syntax highlighting,
  embedding content and more.
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Remark plugins can be used to:

`<CodePen codePenId="jObpJma" tabs={["css", "result"]} />`

<CodePen codePenId="jObpJma" tabs={["css", "result"]} />

<SpeakerNotes>
  For example here within an article written in Markdown I used an embed plugin
  to display a Codepen pen
</SpeakerNotes>

# Remark plugins can be used to:

`<Tweet tweetLink="waterproofheart/status/1201359059791822851" align="center" />`

<Tweet tweetLink="waterproofheart/status/1201359059791822851" align="center" />
<SpeakerNotes>
  and here I used an embed plugin to display an embedded tweet within a Markdown
  article

# Goodbye gatsby-transformer-remark, Hello gatsby-plugin-mdx üëãüèæ

- Gatsby-plugin-mdx is the official integration for using MDX with Gatsby

- Can be used in combination with Remark plugins.

<SpeakerNotes>
  In order to switch over to MDX, I needed to get rid of
  gatsby-transformer-remark and setup gatsby-plugin-mdx. Luckily, MDX also uses
  Remark under the hood to parse its Abstract Syntax Tree and is compatible with
  a lot of Remark plugins.
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# What did migrating look like

- yarn add @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react gatsby-plugin-mdx
- yarn remove gatsby-transformer-remark
- replace ~~gatsby-transformer-remark~~ with `gatsby-plugin-mdx` in config

<SpeakerNotes>
   Migrating to MDX largely looked like installing mdx, mdx-js/react,
  gatsby-plugin-mdx and uninstalling gatsby-transformer-remark. and then removing lingering remnants of gatsby-transformer-remark within the
  gatsby-config.

</SpeakerNotes>

---

# What did migrating look like

Updating queries and references to Markdown nodes to replace references to `allMarkdownRemark` to `allMdx`:

```jsx {diff}
-  const posts = result.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges
+  const posts = result.data.allMDX.edges
```

<br />

```jsx {diff}
- node.internal.type === `MarkdownRemark`
+ node.internal.type) === `Mdx`
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  In addition to updating the gatsby-config, in order to complete the migration
  I needed to update any code references to Markdown to MDX. Within Gatsby data
  such as content is accessed through GraphQL and with the migration from
  Markdown to MDX the name of the GraphQL nodes that needed to be accessed
  changed. For the most part up until now migrating has just involved doing a
  bit of installation and find and replaced.
</SpeakerNotes>

# Cannot Query Field ü§Ø

<Callout variant="danger">
  error Cannot query field "body" on type "Mdx". Did you mean "rawBody"?
  graphql/template-strings
</Callout>

After installing `gatsby-plugin-mdx` and updating all references to Markdown to MDX...

<SpeakerNotes>
  I thought I had covered all my bases finding and replacing Markdown and MDX,
  however I ran into an error accessing some of the fields that should be
  available for mdx nodes like `body`, `timeToRead` and `excerpt`. I wasn't sure
  _why_ this node wasn't available as it's something that the gatsby-mdx plugin
  is supposed to add to the site's GraphQL layer.
</SpeakerNotes>

# Debugging Conflicting Gatsby Plugins üïµüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1. Commented out all of the plugins in gatsbyRemarkPlugins
2. Confirmed that all of the data that should be available in GraphQL to query from MDX was available all gatsbyRemarkPlugins were temporarily removed
3. Re-added each plugin one-by-one to identify the culprit
4. Identified conflict between `gatsby-plugin-mdx` and `gatsby-plugin-my-social-cards`

<SpeakerNotes>
  In order to debug this issue, I ended up opening the GraphQL Playground in
  Gatsby to see what query fields were or were not available. I was then able to
  confirm that the `body`, `timeToRead` etc. fields were not available. Next, I
  commented out all of the remark plugins and then when I re-ran the queries in
  the playground the data that formerly was not available was appearing. I then
  worked my way through all of the installed plugins to identify the culprit by
  determining when the MDX fields disappeared.This resulted in me identifying a
  conflict between `gatsby-plugin-mdx` and `gatsby-plugin-my-social-cards`
</SpeakerNotes>

# Resolving Conflicting Gatsby Plugins

- Plugins that transform the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) can sometimes conflict with each other and behave in unexpected ways.
- Sometimes re-ordering plugins in `gatsby-config` can resolve conflicts.

<Callout>
  {" "}
  Solution: replace gatsby-plugin-my-social-cards with
  gatsby-remark-twitter-cards
</Callout>

<SpeakerNotes>
  Since there was a conflict with `gatsby-plugin-mdx` and the plugin, used to
  generate Open Graph images for all of my posts, I decided to find an
  alternative Open Graph plugin than to investigate the specific plugin conflict
  further as it seemed like it would involve having to modify third party code
  and I wanted a working solution as quickly as possible. Another alternative to
  solving the other issue or switching a plugin is to try to re-order the
  plugins. Some plugins will tell you what order they should be added in to
  reduce conflicts.

# What have I done with MDX so far...

- ‚ú® Upgraded ‚ú® components for code snippets and table of contents
- created additional Callout components to complement markdown quotes
- Added dynamic slider

<SpeakerNotes>
  After the issue retrieving MDX data was resolved it was time to get started
  with actually using MDX on my site! Some of the ways I've used MDX so far is
  to upgrade code snippets to use more customizable JSX instead of markdown,
  dynamic table of contents, added Callout components and added a dynamic slider
  to a post.
</SpeakerNotes>

---

```jsx
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";
import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx";

const components = {
  /* stash React components to be used in MDX blog posts here! */
};

class BlogPostTemplate extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const post = this.props.data.mdx;
    if (!post) return null;

    return (
      <MDXProvider components={components}>
        <MDXRenderer>{post.body}</MDXRenderer>
      </MDXProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  The first thing I needed to do before using MDX was wrapping the MDXProvider
  around my blog post template since I wanted MDX to be available for all of my
  articles. The MDXProvider allows you to pass all of your components in one
  place. This provider wraps both my post content and the MDXRenderer. The
  MDXRenderer is a React component from the MDX Gatsby integration that takes
  compiled MDX content and renders it. It's required if your MDX content is
  coming from a GraphQL page query or StaticQuery.
</SpeakerNotes>

# Table of Contents Component

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "40%", textAlign: "center" }}
  src="/table-of-contents-visual.png"
/>

<SpeakerNotes>
  For my longer articles I like to add a table of contents so that readers can
  view an overview of what to expect in a particular article.
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Before/After MDX

## <img style={{ maxWidth: "80%", textAlign: "center" }} src="/toc-diff.png" />

<SpeakerNotes>
  I liked adding these so much that I was manually writing Markdown to render
  table of contents within my articles. Here's a diff of what the Table of
  Contents for individual posts looked like before and after MDX. After
  implementing MDX, adding table of contents is just a one line reference to a
  component.
</SpeakerNotes>

---

```jsx
import "./TableOfContents.scss";
function TableOfContents({ headings }) {
  return (
    <div className="table-of-contents">
      <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
      <ul>
        {headings.items &&
          headings.items.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.url}>
              <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>{" "}
            </li>
          ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  In order to reduce the amount of TOC that lives in an individual blog post I
  created a Table of Contents JSX component to map through all of the headers
  and display them as list items with links. There's an autolink plugin to
  ensure the anchor link exists.
</SpeakerNotes>

---

```jsx
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";
import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx";
import TableOfContents from "../components/TableOfContents";

const components = {
  TableOfContents,
};

class BlogPostTemplate extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const post = this.props.data.mdx;
    if (!post) return null;

    return (
      <MDXProvider components={components}>
        <MDXRenderer>{post.body}</MDXRenderer>
      </MDXProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  I then imported the new Table of Contents component into the MDX provider in
  my article template, so that this component is accessible to any blog posts. I
  also updated the post query to pass in the tableOfContents field for that post
  as a prop that can then be passed into the TableOfContents components. The
  TableOfContents field is a default available with the Gatsby MDX
  configuration. The TableOfContents field also allows you to pass in a depth to
  pull in subheadings. For my use case I only cared about the first layer but
  the TOC component can be set up to recursively render all of the headings and
  subheadings.

# Callout Banners

<Callout>Here's some important information for you to know!</Callout>
<Callout variant="danger">Oops, there was an error</Callout>
<Callout variant="garden">
  That's all for now! ü•ï I am continuing to update this post, so check back
  later!
</Callout>
<Callout variant="book">
  "Here's a great quote from something I read recently.
</Callout>

Inspired by http://prince.dev/ üíú

<SpeakerNotes>
  Something cool I saw around the web was folks using Callout banners to make
  certain content stand out. I had a similar style already for a markdown quote
  on my blog and was eager to extend the different styles of callouts I could
  include in content so I created a Callout component.
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# Markdown Quote -> JSX Callout Banners

```
> Markdown quote
```

to

```jsx
<>
  <Callout>...</Callout>
  <Callout variant="danger">...</Callout>
  <Callout variant="garden">...</Callout>
  <Callout variant="book">...</Callout>
</>
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  So now in addition to being able to add quotes within blog posts, I can also
  add different variations of the banner by using the Callout component.
</SpeakerNotes>

# Callout Banners

# JSX Callout Variants

```jsx
const variantStyles = {
  info: {
    borderLeft: "4px solid #b4aaff",
    backgroundColor: "rgba(224, 226, 255, 0.5)",
    color: "#2a2135",
  },
  danger: {
    borderLeft: "4px solid #ff7828",
    backgroundColor: "rgb(253, 236, 234)",
  },
  garden: {
    borderLeft: "4px solid #72bc23",
    backgroundColor: "rgb(249, 253, 234)",
  },
  book: {
    borderLeft: "4px solid #44a9ba",
    backgroundColor: "rgb(234, 248, 253);",
  },
};
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  For each variation there are different styles for borderLeft and
  backgroundColor that are based off of the variant that is passed in. In the
  component it also adds CSS classnames based on the variant prop.
</SpeakerNotes>

---

```jsx
/* CSS file for pseudoclasses a.k.a emojis */
import styles from "./callout.module.scss"
export default function Callout({ variant = "info", children }) {
  const classes = `${styles.infoBox} ${styles[variant]}`;
  const variantStyles = {
    ...
  };
  return (
    <aside css={{ /* a bunch of default CSS*/ ...variantStyles[variant],
      }} className={classes} >
      {children}
    </aside>
  );
}
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  The Callout component also has a CSS Module file for the psuedoclasses to show
  the emojis before each callout based on the CSS classname that was appended
  from the variant prop.
</SpeakerNotes>

# Upgraded Code Snippets

- switched from `gatsby-remark-prismsjs` to `prism-react-renderer`
- more robust functionality that‚Äôs available with React/MDX
- some of the `prismjs` extendability was limited within `gatsby-remark-prismsjs` plugin, e.g., the ability the copy to clipboard functionality.

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "50%", textAlign: "center", display: "inline" }}
  src="/code_snippet_without_mdx.png"
/>
<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "50%", textAlign: "center", display: "inline" }}
  src="/code_snippet_with_mdx.png"
/>

---

# Code

```jsx
import Highlight from "prism-react-renderer";
import theme from "prism-react-renderer/themes/palenight";

const Code = ({ codeString, language, metastring, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <Highlight code={codeString} language={language} theme={theme} {...props}>
      {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) =>
        // map through each token and render the line of code
      }
    </Highlight>
  );
};
```

---

# Using Code component

```jsx
import TableOfContents from "../components/TableOfContents";
import Callout from "../components/Callout";
import { preToCodeBlock } from "mdx-utils";
import Code from "./code";

const components = { const components = {
TableOfContents,
Callout,
pre: preProps => {
const props = preToCodeBlock(preProps)
  if (props) {
  return <Code {...props} />
  } else {
  return <pre {...preProps} />
  }
},
 } }
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  In the components that are passed into the MDXProvider. preToCodeBlock allows
  us to replace `<pre />` with out custom component and also retains any props
  that were passed in the MDX. Sources: https://mdxjs.com/blog/custom-pragma,

# Updated Syntax

The syntax for code snippets varied a bit between the two plugins so I manually searched through my code examples to make sure the syntax was updated to render properly with the updated plugin (i.e., if there were highlighted lines the right lines were still being highlighted)
