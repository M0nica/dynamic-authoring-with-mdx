# Hi, I'm Monica üëãüèæ

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. I am excited to share how you can super-charge content creation with MDX.

# But, what is MDX?

<Callout variant="plain">
  MDX can refer to either the syntax <em>or</em> library
</Callout>

<Callout variant="plain">
  The MDX <em>library</em> converts MDX <em>syntax</em> ‚û° JSX
</Callout>

<Callout variant="plain">JSX is compiled by Babel/Webpack for browser</Callout>

<SpeakerNotes>
  You can refer to MDX as the library that converts MDX syntax to JSX or as the
  syntax that is written. MDX is converted into JSX which is ultimately compiled
  for browser by tools like Babel or Webpack.

# MDX in Action: live code editor

<LiveCode
  title=""
  size="large"
  code='
  <h1>"JSX in Markdown for ambitious projects" ‚ú®</h1>'
/>

<SpeakerNotes>

First, you may be wonder what is MDX? At the simplest level it's a programming syntax that supports writing JSX in Markdown.

MDX brands itself as "JSX in Markdown for ambitious projects".

These slides are written in MDX and using mdx-deck-live-code to show how you can use React components within Markdown (MDX) files to add rich interactivity.

# MDX in Action: Third-Party Embeds

`<CodePen codePenId="jObpJma" tabs={["css", "result"]} />`

<CodePen codePenId="jObpJma" tabs={["css", "result"]} />

_Above embed powered by `mdx-embed`_.

<SpeakerNotes>
  For example here within an article written in Markdown I used an embed plugin
  to display a Codepen pen

# Why MDX?

<Callout variant="plain">
  strong authoring experience for technical contributors
</Callout>
<Callout variant="plain">
  seamlessly import React components into MDX files
</Callout>

<Callout variant="plain">

create more engaging, interactive content with the ease of componentized markdown

</Callout>

<SpeakerNotes>
  I started using MDX after hearing other developers talk about the enhanced
  functionality that MDX can add to websites. I was especially interested in
  exploring MDX for creating engaging and interactive content after seeing fun
  examples of content that resonated with me that used MDX.
</SpeakerNotes>

# Getting Started with MDX

`.md` ‚û°Ô∏è `.mdx`

```js
const mdx = require("@mdx-js/mdx");
const { MDXProvider, mdx: createElement } = require("@mdx-js/react");
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  Update Markdown extensions to have the mdx extension. There are specific
  instructions on the MDX Doc site to set up with different bundlers and
  frameworks including webpack, parcel, next, create-react-app, gatsby and more.
  At a bare minimum you will need to use @mdx-js/react package and the
  @mdx-js/mdx package.

# Importing Custom Components

- centralized place to make components globally accessible
- wraps layout pages

```js
import React from "react";
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";
import { SignUp, TableOfContents } from "./components";

const components = {
  Signup,
  TableOfContents,
};

export default (props) => (
  <MDXProvider components={components}>
    <main {...props} />
  </MDXProvider>
);
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  The first thing I needed to do before using MDX was wrapping the MDXProvider
  around my blog post template since I wanted MDX to be available for all of my
  articles. The MDXProvider allows you to pass the components you want to be
  available to all of the pages that are within that context in one place. This
  provider wraps both my post content.

# Table of Contents Component

<img
  style={{ maxWidth: "40%", textAlign: "center" }}
  src="/table-of-contents-visual.png"
/>

<SpeakerNotes>
  For my longer articles I like to add a table of contents so that readers can
  view an overview of what to expect in a particular article.
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# TOC: Before/After MDX

<img style={{ maxWidth: "80%", textAlign: "center" }} src="/toc-diff.png" />

<SpeakerNotes>
  I liked adding these so much that I was manually writing Markdown to render
  table of contents within my articles. Here's a diff of what the Table of
  Contents for individual posts looked like before and after MDX. After
  implementing MDX, adding table of contents is just a one line reference to a
  component.
</SpeakerNotes>

---

# TableOfContents.jsx

```jsx
import "./TableOfContents.scss";
function TableOfContents({ headings }) {
  return (
    <div className="table-of-contents">
      <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
      <ul>
        {headings.items &&
          headings.items.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.url}>
              <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>{" "}
            </li>
          ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  In order to reduce the amount of TOC that lives in an individual blog post I
  created a Table of Contents JSX component to map through all of the headers
  and display them as list items with links. There's an autolink plugin to
  ensure the anchor link exists. The headings are being passed in from the
  TableOfContents data field which has a headings attribute.
</SpeakerNotes>

# ArticleTemplate.jsx

```jsx
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";
import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx";
import TableOfContents from "../components/TableOfContents";

const components = {
  TableOfContents,
};

class BlogPostTemplate extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const post = this.props.data.mdx;
    if (!post) return null;

    return (
      <MDXProvider components={components}>
        <MDXRenderer tableOfContents={post.tableOfContents}>
          {post.body}
        </MDXRenderer>
      </MDXProvider>
    );
  }
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostBySlug($slug: String!, $permalink: String!) {
    mdx(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) {
      id
      timeToRead
      body
      tableOfContents
      frontmatter {
        title
        date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

<SpeakerNotes>
  I then imported the new Table of Contents component into the MDX provider in
  my article template, so that this component is accessible to any blog posts.
  In Gatby applications you also need to import an MDXRenderer which is a React
  component from the MDX Gatsby integration that takes compiled MDX content and
  renders it. It's required if your MDX content is coming from a GraphQL page
  query or StaticQuery. I also updated the post query to pass in the
  tableOfContents field for that post as a prop that can then be passed into the
  TableOfContents components. The TableOfContents field is a default available
  with the Gatsby MDX configuration. The TableOfContents field also allows you
  to pass in a depth tot pull in subheadings. For my use case I only cared about
  the first layer but the TOC component can be set up to recursively render all
  of the headings and subheadings.

# MDX Example: <ArticleList/> in Article

- can import ArticleList directly into `.mdx` file (outside of MDXProvider)

- site programmatically passes data into `<Articlelist/>` from the result of a GraphQL query
- article uses hard-coded data (R) within a `.mdx` file to render the below instance of the `<ArticleList/>` component (L):

# Walkthrough: Timer

Add a timer or a countdown into a markdown file with the following:

`<CountDown minutes="1" seconds="30" />`

# Summary

- MDX provides a better developer experience to anhance content written in Markdown
- The sky is the limit ‚òÅÔ∏è in terms of how MDX can be used to enhance content
