# Migrating Blog to MDX 📝

# Why I migrated to MDX

- FOMO Driven Development
- to create engaging and interactive content!

---

# What is Remark?

A collection of Markdown parser plugins that check, lint, generate and compiles Markdown.

https://remark.js.org/

---

# Transformer Remark Plugins

In Gatsby, Remark Transformer plugins are used to transform
Markdown on a site into HTML.

<img style={{ maxWidth: "50%", textAlign: "center" }} src={MDtoHTML} />

---

# Remark plugins can be used to:

- autolink headers with anchor tags
- process responsive images
- add syntax highlight
- embed content
- and more!

# Goodbye gatsby-transformer-remark, Hello gatsby-plugin-mdx 👋🏾

- Gatsby-plugin-mdx is the official integration for using MDX with Gatsby

- Can be used in combination with Remark plugins.

<Notes> Considered a regular Gatsby plugin vs. Remark plugin </Notes>

# Cannot Query Field

`error Cannot query field "body" on type "Mdx". Did you mean "rawBody"? graphql/template-strings`

I ran into an error accessing some of the fields that should be available for mdx nodes like body,timeToRead and excerpt.

---

# Debugging Conflicting Gatsby Plugins

1. Commented out all of the plugins in gatsbyRemarkPlugins
2. Confirmed that all of the data that should be available to query from mdx was available without Remark plugins.
3. Re-added each plugin one-by-one to identify the culprit

---

# Resolving Conflicting Gatsby Plugins

- There was a conflict with gatsby-plugin-mdx and the plugin, gatsby-plugin-my-social-cards, used to generate Open Graph images for all of my posts.

- Fix: replacing gatsby-plugin-my-social-cards with gatsby-remark-twitter-cards

# What have I done with it?

# Added Table of Contents Component

# Added Callout Banners

<Callout>Here's some important information for you to know!</Callout>
<Callout variant="danger">Oops, there was an error</Callout>
<Callout variant="garden">
  That's all for now! 🥕 I am continuing to update this post, so check back
  later!
</Callout>
<Callout variant="book">
  "Here's a great quote from something I read recently.
</Callout>

# What have I done with it?

Upgraded the code snippets on my site’s blog post to be powered by React a.k.a MDX!

I wanted to be able to easily add additional functionality to code snippets on my site like click to copy functionality

I was using `gatsby-remark-prismjs` and ran into some issue since currently additional support for PrismJS plugin environment variables is [in development](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20642).

I decided to switch to `prism-react-renderer` in order to tap into the more robust functionality that’s available with React/MDX.

---

# What did migrating look like:

- different syntax
  The line highlighting syntax I was using from `gatsby-remark-prismjs` involved adding in-line comments like
  `// highlight-start` and `// highlight-end`. In order to translate the highlighting over to `prism-react-renderer` I needed to update to use their syntax which looks like

````

```jsx {2-6}
```

which highlights based on line number.

Prism-react-renderer is a lot more flexible then gatsby-remark-prismjs

> I was wondering how certain websites are able to display language and copy to clipboard feature as seen in the photo below.

> A custom code block for MDX and some CSS: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/www/src/components/code-block/index.js > https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/www/src/utils/styles/global.js

Display language is also possible with gatsby-remark-prismjs https://www.lekoarts.de/en/blog/language-tabs-for-gatsbys-code-blocks

    - Added callouts with different variants
    - Table of contents — reduced amount of code that needed to be written to load table of contents
